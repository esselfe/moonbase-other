cat << EOF
umockdev mocks Linux devices for creating integration tests for hardware
related libraries and programs. It also provides tools to record the properties
and behaviour of particular devices, and to run a program or test suite under
a test bed with the previously recorded devices loaded. This allows developers
of software like gphoto or libmtp to receive these records in bug reports and
recreate the problem on their system without having access to the
affected hardware.
