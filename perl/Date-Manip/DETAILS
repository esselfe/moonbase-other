Date::Manip:
A perl 5 module which allows you to easily parse and manipulate dates
(several different foreign languages are supported and more can be
added easily, international date formats are also supported). A date
calculator is also included to tell the time elapsed between two dates,
or to find a date a certain amount of time from a given date.
Calculations can also be done using a special business mode where
weekends and holidays are ignored.
