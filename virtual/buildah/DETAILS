cat << EOF
The Buildah provides a command line tool that can be used to:
 - create a working container, either from scratch or using an image as a
   starting point
 - create an image, either from a working container or via the
   instructions in a Dockerfile
 - images can be built in either the OCI image format or the traditional
   upstream docker image format
 - mount a working https://github.com/containers/buildahcontainer's root
   filesystem for manipulation
 - unmount a working container's root filesystem
 - use the updated contents of a container's root filesystem as a filesystem
   layer to create a new image
 - delete a working container or an image
 - rename a local container
