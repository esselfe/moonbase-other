cat << EOF
PHP is a widely-used opensource general-purpose scripting language that is
especially suited for Web development and can be embedded into HTML. Its syntax
draws upon C, Java, and Perl, and is easy to learn. PHP runs on many different
platforms and can be used as a standalone executable or as a module under a
variety of Web servers.
It has excellent support for databases, XML, LDAP, Java, various Internet
protocols, and general data manipulation, and is extensible via its powerful
API. It is actively developed and supported by a talented and energetic
international team. Numerous Open Source and commercial PHP-based application
packages are available.
