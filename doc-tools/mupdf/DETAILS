The renderer in MuPDF is tailored for high-quality anti-aliased graphics. It
renders text with metrics and spacing accurate to within fractions of a pixel
for the highest fidelity in reproducing the look of a printed page on screen.
MuPDF has support for all non-interactive PDF 1.7 features, and the toolkit
provides a simple API for accessing the internal structures of the PDF document.
