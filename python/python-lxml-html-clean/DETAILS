cat << EOF
This project was initially a part of lxml. Because HTML cleaner is designed as
blocklist-based, many reports about possible security vulnerabilities were filed
for lxml and that make the project problematic for security-sensitive environments.
Therefore we decided to extract the problematic part to a separate project.
