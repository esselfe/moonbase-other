cat << EOF
The libXML library allows you to manipulate XML files. It offers SAX or DOM
tree generation interfaces. It supports XML and HTML (real-world ones) parsing,
flexible DTD validation, XPath, XPointer-XInclude, and pull and push modes with
FTP and HTTP modules. It's written in C and should be fairly portable.
The design is modular; most of the extensions can be compiled out.
