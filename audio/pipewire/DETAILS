cat << EOF
PipeWire is a server and user space API to deal with multimedia pipelines.
This includes:
  - Making available sources of video (such as from a capture devices or
    application provided streams) and multiplexing this with clients.
  - Accessing sources of video for consumption.
  - Generating graphs for audio and video processing.
Nodes in the graph can be implemented as separate processes, communicating with
sockets and exchanging multimedia content using fd passing.
