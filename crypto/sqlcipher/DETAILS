           SHORT="SQLite extension that provides encryption of database files"

cat << EOF
SQLCipher is an open source extension to SQLite that provides transparent
256-bit AES encryption of database files.
Pages are encrypted before being written to disk and are decrypted when
read back. Due to the small footprint and great performance itâ€™s ideal for
protecting embedded application databases and is well suited for mobile
development.
Features:
  Fast performance with as little as 5-15% overhead for encryption on many
  operations.
  100% of data in the database file is encrypted.
  Good security practices (CBC mode, key derivation).
  Zero-configuration and application level cryptography.
  Algorithms provided by the peer reviewed OpenSSL crypto library.
  Configurable crypto providers.
