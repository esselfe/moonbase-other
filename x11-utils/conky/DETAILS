Conky is a program which can display arbitrary information (such as the date,
CPU temperature from i2c, MPD info, and anything else you desire) to the root
window in X11. Conky normally does this by drawing to the root window, however
Conky can also be run in windowed mode (though this is not how conky was meant
to be used).
