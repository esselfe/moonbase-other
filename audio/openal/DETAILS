OpenAL is a cross-platform 3D audio API, appropriate for use with
gaming applications and many other types of audio applications.

The library models a collection of audio sources moving in a 3D space
that are heard by a single listener somewhere in that space. The basic
OpenAL objects are a Listener, a Source, and a Buffer. There can be a
large number of Buffers, which contain audio data. Each buffer can be
attached to one or more Sources, which represent points in 3D space
which are emitting audio. There is always one Listener object (per
audio context), which represents the position where the sources are
heard -- rendering is done from the perspective of the Listener.

OpenAl was developed by Loki specifically for 3D gaming purposes.
