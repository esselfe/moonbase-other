cat << EOF
memcached is a high-performance, distributed memory object caching system,
generic in nature, but intended for use in speeding up dynamic web applications
by alleviating database load. It uses libevent to scale to any number of open
connections (using epoll on Linux, if available at runtime), uses non-blocking
network I/O, refcounts internal objects (so objects can be in multiple states
to multiple clients), and uses its own slab allocator and hash table so virtual
memory never gets externally fragmented and allocations are guaranteed O(1).
