cat << EOF
Pluggable, composable, unopinionated modules for building a Wayland compositor.

 - wlroots provides backends that abstract the underlying display and input
   hardware, including KMS/DRM, libinput, Wayland, X11, and headless backends,
   plus any custom backends you choose to write, which can all be created or
   destroyed at runtime and used in concert with each other.

 - wlroots provides unopinionated, mostly standalone implementations of many
   Wayland interfaces, both from wayland.xml and various protocol extensions.
   We also promote the standardization of portable extensions across many
   compositors.

 - wlroots provides several powerful, standalone, and optional tools that
   implement components common to many compositors, such as the arrangement of
   outputs in physical space.

 - wlroots provides an Xwayland abstraction that allows you to have excellent
   Xwayland support without worrying about writing your own X11 window manager
   on top of writing your compositor.

 - wlroots provides a renderer abstraction that simple compositors can use to
   avoid writing GL code directly, but which steps out of the way when your
   needs demand custom rendering code.

wlroots implements a huge variety of Wayland compositor features and implements
them right, so you can focus on the features that make your compositor unique.
By using wlroots, you get high performance, excellent hardware compatibility,
broad support for many wayland interfaces, and comfortable development tools -
or any subset of these features you like, because all of them work independently
of one another and freely compose with anything you want to implement yourself.
