Ctags generates an index (or tag) file of language objects found in
source files that allows these items to be quickly and easily located
by a text editor or other utility. A tag signifies a language object
for which an index entry is available (or, alternatively, the index
entry created for that object).

Tag generation is supported for the following languages:
Assembler, AWK, ASP, BETA, Bourne/Korn/Zsh Shell, C, C++, COBOL, Eiffel,
Fortran, Java, Lisp, Lua, Make, Pascal, Perl, PHP, Python, REXX, Ruby,
S-Lang, Scheme, Tcl, Vim, and YACC.
