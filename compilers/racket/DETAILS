cat << EOF
Racket is a full-spectrum programming language. It goes beyond Lisp and Scheme
with dialects that support objects, types, laziness, and more. Racket enables
programmers to link components written in different dialects, and it empowers
programmers to create new, project-specific dialects. Racket's libraries
support applications from web servers and databases to GUIs and charts.
Formerly known as PLT Scheme.
