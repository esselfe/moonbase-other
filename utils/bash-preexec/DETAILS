cat << EOF
bash-preexec provides hook functions for Bash that emulate Zsh's preexec and
precmd functionality. It enables two main hooks:

- preexec: Executes automatically after a command is entered but before it runs,
  receiving the typed command as an argument
- precmd: Triggers just before the shell prompt displays, functioning as a more
  flexible alternative to PROMPT_COMMAND

This is particularly useful for tools that need to track command execution,
measure timing, or modify the environment before/after commands run. It is used
by production applications including Bashhub, iTerm2, Fig, and Atuin.
