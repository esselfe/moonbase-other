cat << EOF
The librsvg library is a lightweight library for parsing and rendering vector-
graphic files in SVG format (like the ones made by sodipodi). It also includes
functions that render anti-aliased fonts using freetype, including caching of
glyphs. It's used by Nautilus for drawing vector icons and anti-aliased type.
