cat << EOF
mpeg2dec is a test program for libmpeg2. It decodes mpeg-1 and mpeg-2 video
streams, and also includes a demultiplexer for mpeg-1 and mpeg-2 program
streams. It is purposely kept simple: it does not include features like
reading files from a DVD, CSS, fullscreen output, navigation, etc...
The main purpose of mpeg2dec is to have a simple test bed for libmpeg2.
The libmpeg2 source code is always distributed in the mpeg2dec package, to
make it easier for people to test it.
