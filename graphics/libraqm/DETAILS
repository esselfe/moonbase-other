cat << EOF
Raqm is a small library that encapsulates the logic for complex text layout and provides a
convenient API. It currently provides bidirectional text support (using FriBiDi), shaping
(using HarfBuzz), and proper script itemization. As a result, Raqm can support most writing
systems covered by Unicode.

The documentation can be accessed on the web at:
    http://host-oman.github.io/libraqm/
Raqm (Arabic: رَقْم) is writing, also number or digit and the Arabic word for
digital (رَقَمِيّ) shares the same root, so it is a play on “digital writing”.
