cat << EOF
Mutt is a small but very powerful text-based MIME mail client. It is highly
configurable, and is well-suited to the mail power user with advanced features
like key bindings, keyboard macros, mail threading, regular expression searches,
and a powerful pattern matching language for selecting groups of messages.
