Dust is meant to give you an instant overview of which directories are using
disk space without requiring sort or head. Dust will print a maximum of one
'Did not have permissions message'.
Dust will list a slightly-less-than-the-terminal-height number of the biggest
subdirectories or files and will smartly recurse down the tree to find the
larger ones. There is no need for a '-d' flag or a '-h' flag.
The largest subdirectories will be colored.
