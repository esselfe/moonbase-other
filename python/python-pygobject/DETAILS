cat << EOF
PyGObject provides a convenient wrapper for the GObject+ library for use in
Python programs, and takes care of many of the boring details such as managing
memory and type casting.  When combined with PyGTK, PyORBit and gnome-python,
it can be used to write full featured GNOME applications.
