           SHORT="Portable Hardware Locality"

cat << EOF
The Portable Hardware Locality (hwloc) software package provides a portable
abstraction (across OS, versions, architectures...) of the hierarchical topology
of modern architectures, including NUMA memory nodes, sockets, shared caches,
cores and simultaneous multithreading.
It also gathers various system attributes such as cache and memory information
as well as the locality of I/O devices such as network interfaces, InfiniBand
HCAs or GPUs.
It primarily aims at helping applications with gathering information about
modern computing hardware so as to exploit it accordingly and efficiently.
